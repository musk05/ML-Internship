# ML-Internship-from-Verzeo
In my first internship of ML with Python I was supposed to submit 2 projects -
1 minor individually to clean the data , perform EDA and answer some questions related to it.
And the other major project in a group of 5 interns to clean the data , perform EDA , perform Ensemble Modelling and answer some questions related to it.
